# Fix Recruitment
Ideas to fix recruitment, starting with a summary of all that's wrong.

## Summary of what's wrong

###Problem 1 - Recruiters
Recruiters are mostly a noisy waste of time and money - they add very little value to the supply chain
###Problem 2 - Programmers
Programmers are over-reliant on recruiters, because it is inefficient to find and contact employers directly
###Problem 3 - Employers
Employers are over-reliant on recruiters, because they lack time and reach (audience)
###Problem 4 - Too much crap
Employers who do advertise directly face a barrage of crap from unqualified applicants and aggressive agencies alike. Programmers face a similar barrage of crap when they declare their availability.

With all the noise it becomes impractical for candidates to apply directly; their application is easily lost in the noise.

###Problem 5 - Sales-driven
The recruitment industry is so lucrative it attracts people with primarily sales skills (rather than people with technical recruitment skills). The industry is driven by sales targets, cold calls, grabbing all the CVs, and success tends to go to agents who favour quantity over quality.

###Problem 6 - Discriminatory recruiters
Sexism, racism and transphobia can be just as prevalent amongst recruiters as it is in the rest of the tech industry. Women applicants, POC and members of the LGBTQ community are frequently treated differently, including: 
- not being put forward for roles
- being only put forward for more junior roles
- harassment and offensive comments from recruiters

This clearly has a huge impact on the careers of a lot of marginalised groups.
